# ScamPreventionApp

A React Native + Expo app that trains users to recognize scams through realistic simulations of phone calls, text messages, and emails.

## Features

###  Two Modes

**Test Mode** - Take a scored test with 6 random scenarios (mix of scams and legitimate messages). Get graded A-F based on your responses.

**Practice Mode** - Explore individual scenarios at your own pace with optional guided walkthroughs.

###  Phone Call Scams
- **Grandchild Emergency** - Fake family member in trouble asking for money
- **Bank Fraud Department** - Caller pretending to be from your bank's security team
- **Hydro-Québec** - Fake utility company threatening service disconnection

###  Text Message Scams
- **Canada Post Fee** - Fake delivery notification asking for payment
- **Hydro-Québec Refund** - Phishing link disguised as a refund offer
- **TD Bank Security** - Fake security alert with malicious download

###  Email Scams
- **Loto-Québec Prize** - Fake lottery winning notification

###  Legitimate Scenarios (for Test Mode)
The app also includes real legitimate messages to train users not to be overly paranoid:
- Canada Post delivery updates
- Medical clinic reminders
- SAAQ notices
- Google security codes
- CRA account updates
- Desjardins activity alerts

###  Fake Websites
Realistic phishing page simulations:
- Hydro-Québec login page
- Canada Post payment portal
- TD Bank security update page
- Loto-Québec prize claim site

## Scoring (Test Mode)
